# Odin Recipes

Welcome to my **Odin Recipes** project!

This project is part of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) **Foundations** course. The goal is to build a basic recipe website using only HTML.

## Purpose

- Learn and practice writing semantic HTML.
- Understand how to link pages and work with images and lists.
- Build and structure a simple multi-page website.
- Get comfortable using Git and GitHub for version control.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Creating and linking HTML pages.
- Organizing content using lists, headings, and images.
- Using Git commands like `clone`, `add`, `commit`, and `push`.
- Writing Markdown for documentation.
- Setting up a GitHub repository via SSH.

## Reflection

_(To be completed after the project is done!)_

This section will include a self-review of what I learned, what challenged me, and how I overcame it.
